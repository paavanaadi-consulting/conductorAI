# =============================================================================
# ML Pipeline Requirements Template
# =============================================================================
# Specialized template for end-to-end ML pipelines including training,
# deployment, monitoring, and retraining automation (MLOps).
# This is the comprehensive ai-ml-requirements-template.yaml renamed for clarity.
# For full ML pipeline requirements, use ai-ml-requirements-template.yaml
# =============================================================================

# Note: This template points to the comprehensive AI/ML template.
# Use ai-ml-requirements-template.yaml for complete ML pipeline specifications.

# Quick Reference for ML Pipeline Components:
# 1. Data Requirements - Training data, features, labels
# 2. Model Requirements - Algorithms, hyperparameters, performance targets
# 3. Training Pipeline - Orchestration, stages, compute resources
# 4. Deployment Pipeline - Inference endpoints, batch processing
# 5. Monitoring Pipeline - Performance tracking, drift detection
# 6. Retraining Pipeline - Triggers, automation, CI/CD for ML

# Refer to: ai-ml-requirements-template.yaml for the complete specification
